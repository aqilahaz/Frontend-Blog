            Who's At Fault?</a></h2>
        <div class="post-preview">
          <p>Nowadays, there are quite a lot environmental problems in the world. One of them is <strong>anthropogenic
              pollution.</strong> Anthropogenic pollution is a very serious problem that has been discussed lately
            because it has been an unsolved problem since the first period of humans began to learn control the waste
            until now. </p>
          <br>
          <p>If we look back to the past, anthropogenic pollution was not a quite big issue compared to now. The amount
            of pollution began to increase after the Industrial Revolution when the population started to produce
            diverse
            products with chemical compounds as the main materials. These chemical-based products are still heavily
            produced until now, despite several researches and studies have stated that the products cause anthropogenic
            pollution. This kind of pollution is dangerous because it consists of toxic chemical that threaten both
            human and animal health and also the climate. Thus several countries began to take an action and united in a
            global partnership called as United Nation to put this issue as The <strong>2030 Agenda for Sustainable
              Development.</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>
            UN realized that to be able to avoid the worst possibility that might happened because of this issue, they
            need to come up with strategies while tackling the climate change issue and work together to preserve the
            ocean and rain-forest at the same time. 
            <br></p>
            <blockquote>One of the solutions ─ waste management is in line with the
            Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) target, that in 2030 every country substantially reduces waste
            production through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reusing the waste, so it can guarantee sustainable
            production and consumption patterns.&nbsp;</blockquote>

          <h3>How many years does it take for the nature to decompose plastic?&nbsp;</h3>
          </p>
          <p>One of the dangerous anthropogenic pollutions is a plastic waste. Plastic waste is difficult to decompose
            by nature. Normally, plastic items take up to <strong>1000 years</strong> to decompose in landfills. The
            plastic bag we usually use in our everyday life takes <strong>10-20 years</strong> to decompose, while
            plastic bottles take <strong>450 years&nbsp;</strong>. The amount of plastic waste continues to increase
            year by year due to the increasing economic growth. The waste of the manufacturing industry is one of the
            biggest contributors, followed by household waste. According to the Indonesian Ministry of Industry in 2016,
            the amount of waste in Indonesia has reached 65.2 million tons per year.&nbsp;</p>
          <br>
          <p>Plastic waste is not only affecting the land but also the water. Some people in several countries still
            have a bad habit to throw the garbage in the river. The stream that supposed to be clear becomes dirty. This
            reduces water quality. The garbage flow from the streams along the way to the sea. This cause the sea
            becomes dirty and the creatures inside get affected by them.&nbsp;</p>
          <br>
          <p>Indonesia is one of the countries that still have this habit. The river water in several regions in
            Indonesia is heavily polluted mainly because of household waste. In 2018, 25.1% of villages in Indonesia
            experienced water pollution and around 2.7% of the land had contaminated. The accumulation of the garbage
            that was thrown to the stream leads to several flood disasters. This often happens in Indonesia. The number
            of flood disasters increases from year by year. Up until 2017, there were 1805 floods occurred and caused
            433 fatalities.</p>

          <br>
          <h3>What will happen if the plastic waste enter the sea?</h3>
          </p>
          <p>When plastic waste enter the sea, each of them will split into small particles from 0.3-5 millimeters and
            often called as microplastic. Microplastic that scattered in the sea will threaten the ecosystem and the
            live of the organism under the sea, such as coral reefs, fish, and turtle. Organism like fish and turtle
            prone to accidentally consuming the microplastic. They might not be able to see it and mistake it as
            plankton or other small fish. In other case, microplastic can also accidentally enter the fish body due to
            the strong water currents. In addition, if humans consume fish that contaminated with microplastic, it can
            be dangerous to our health too. According to Indonesian Plastic Industry Association and the Indonesian
            Statistics Agency (Badan Pusat Statistik) the number of plastic waste in Indonesia has reached 64 million
            tons per year, where 3.2 million of it was thrown into the sea, so that means there are 85,000 tons of
            plastic bags in Indonesian sea.</p>

          <h3>How does the plastic impact the environment? Who will take the responsibility of the plastics waste
              problems?</h3>
          </p>
          <p>The bad habits of throwing away the waste in the river and sea for sure have a real, long lasting impact
            for the environment, health, diversity of aquatic creatures, social life. Plastic waste is one of the
            biggest problem in Indonesia. It was a national issue last year, when Indonesia hosted Asian Games in August
            2018. The Sentiong River in Jakarta was severely covered with various types of garbage, and mostly were the
            plastic waste from industrial and household waste. Since it was full of garbage it caused the water to turn
            into black which is why people often called the river as ‘Kali Item’ or the black river. Moreover there is
            foul smell emanating from the river, caused by the water evaporating under the sun. The government began to
            try to solve this problem only because the Asian Games athlete’s guest house was located near the river in
            Kemayoran Pusat. This might disturb the Asian Games participants who stayed at the athlete's guesthouse,
            therefore the governments decided to cover the whole river with black nylon mesh.</p>
          <br>
          <p>We are aware that covering the river is not a sustainable solution. Therefore, we need to reduce our
            plastic waste now. In order to do that, we have to collaborate with government, NGO, manufacturing industry,
            researcher, and common society. In other word, it is our responsibility now. We can do it in various way,
            such as: do not litter, reduce the usage of plastic, and start living with zero waste system. I'm ready to
            start it, how about you?</p>

        <p>Hi! We are <strong>Greenies</strong>!</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">Greenis Team consist of 2 members and 1 mentor that recently university students
          in Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia. We believe that nature is something we need to perceive all creatures
          in this world to live fine. As we know that the amount of plastic waste in the world is increasing and it
          ultimately causes various problems. So, this anxiety made us realize that actually we have lot of smart ideas
          that may help tackle this problems; from the latest advanced research until creating zero waste life style as
          new behaviour. Once again, we believe that all this ideas is just so damn cool and awesome. Make sure you are
          part of it. Let’s surving and find out what else you can do to save our planet!</p>

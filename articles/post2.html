        <h1>Bioplastic The Synthetic Plastic Eco-Friendly Substitute</h1>
        <p>The plastic use in the entire world keep growing day by day and surely the side-effects become more and more
          visible in our environment. Have you ever wonder is there any substitute for synthetic plastic? Yes there is!

            Waste Problems </a></h2>
        <div class="post-preview">
          <p>After knowing the effects from plastic waste in the previous article ─&nbsp;Bioplastic from SDG’s POV and
            Its Importance, the next question is, is there any other materials that can substitute the plastic use? Yup,
            one of them is bioplastic. Bioplastic appeared as brand new solution to substitute the plastic use that
            keeps growing by time. When you try to google “Bioplastic” you will find some latest articles and researches
            about it.</p>
          <br>
          <blockquote> To put it in a simple way, bioplastic is a material that has similar texture with synthetic plastic. What
            makes it different from the synthetic plastic is, the bioplastic naturally can get redecomposed again by
            microorganism as an eco-friendly compound.</blockquote>
            <br>
            <p> Compared to the synthetic plastic, bioplastic consists of way
            more environmental friendly components and it reduces the carbon emission footprints by humans. Bioplastic
            are made from components that consist of organism polymer such as glucose, cellulose starch, and cotton
            either using only half of it or the entire thing (Chen, 2014). Bioplastic is biodegraddable─ability to
            decompose an organic compound as carbon dioxide, methane, water, inorganic component, or biomass through
            enzimatic mircroorganism reaction (Latief, 2001).&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><em>Bioplastic is naturally easy to get decomposed in a short time and also environment
              friendly.&nbsp;</em>
          </p>
          <p>Bioplastic can be made either by household industry or manufacturing industry. Bioplastic manufacturing
            industry commonly uses cassava starch that consists of high percentage of amylum (starch). Bioplastic can
            also be made from cellulose, PLA (Poli Lactic Acid) from cane, starch from other plants such as rice starch,
            corn starch, potato starch, and taro starch. Other compounds like PHB (Poly-3-Hydroxibutirat), PHA
            (Poly-Hydroksialkanoat), PCL (Polycaprolactone), PBS (Poly butylene succinate), and PA (Polyamide) can also
            be used to make bioplastic.</p>

            <img src="../img/figure1.jpg" alt="Bioplastic">
            <figcaption>Bioplastic consist of Biodegradable plastics and Bio-based plastics Sources; (Tokiwa et al.,
              2009)</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <br>
          <p>Bioplastic consists of biodegradable plastic (plastic that is made from fossil components) and bio-based
            plastic (plastic that is made from synthetic biomass or renewable energy). The connection between
            biodegradable and bio-based plastic can be seen from image above. Polycaprolactone (PCL) and Poly (Butylene)
            (PBS) based from crude oil, but they can be degraded by microorganism. On the contrary, poly
            (Hidroxybutyrate) (PHB), poli (Lactide) (PLA), and starch mixture are obtained from biomass or renewable
            energy thus they are biodegradable (Tokiwa et al., 2009).</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>How come bioplastic degradation process takes shorter time than synthetic plastic?</h3>
          </p>
          <p>Usually it takes several hundred years for synthetic plastic to be able to get degraded completely whereas
            it only takes 3 to 6 months for bioplastic to get degraded completely.&nbsp;</p>
          <br>
          <h3>How come they are so different?</h3>
          </p>
          <p>There are several factors that differentiate the degradation process between bioplastic and synthetic
            plastic, which are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Biological process.</strong> The degradation process in bioplastic use bacterias, fungis, small animals,
              predators, and high classified organisms.</li>
            <li><strong>Chemical process,</strong> through hydrolysis and oxidation reaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Mechanic process,</strong> through cleaning, using the sunlight, and climates (Chiellini, 2001).</li>
            <li>Bioplastic that consists of starch blending is easier to be degraded instead of the common synthetic
              plastic. There are several researches that try to degrade bioplastic using microorganisms such as fungus
              and bacteria. The starch blending bioplastic that is degraded using fungus utilize the carbon / C in
              starch first before degrading the plastic polymer. The fungus degradation rate depends on the amount of
              starch composition that is used as additive ingredients. As much as starch components in bioplastic, the
              fungus will be faster to degrade it. If the C component from the starch is already up, then the fungus
              will likely to use the C component from HDPE by sticking to the bioplastic surface through electrostatic
              charge, then using its components as the main nutrient resources.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <p>There are some microorganisms that can convert the starch by break down the starch to glucose such as
            <em>Aspergillus oryzae</em>, <em>Rhizopus oryzae</em>, and <em>Mucor</em> sp (Ade, 2013). Fungus that can
            produce&nbsp;α-amylase&nbsp;and break down the bioplastic componenets are <em>Aspergilus oryzae</em>,
            <em>Aspergillus niger, Paecilomyces subglobosum, Mucor pusilus,&nbsp;</em>and <em>Thermomyces
              lanuginosus</em> (Forgaty, 1983).&nbsp;</p>
          <br>
          <p>How is it? Do you agree that bioplastic is one of the best solution out there to fight the synthetic
            plastic waste invasion? The researches has found the technology to support it, so it is our time to support
            it as well. <blockquote><strong>Are you ready to be the changemaker to save our earth?</strong></blockquote></p>

        <p>Hi! We are <strong>Greenies</strong>!</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">Greenis Team consist of 2 members and 1 mentor that recently university students
          in Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia. We believe that nature is something we need to perceive all creatures
          in this world to live fine. As we know that the amount of plastic waste in the world is increasing and it
          ultimately causes various problems. So, this anxiety made us realize that actually we have lot of smart ideas
          that may help tackle this problems; from the latest advanced research until creating zero waste life style as
          new behaviour. Once again, we believe that all this ideas is just so damn cool and awesome. Make sure you are
          part of it. Let’s surving and find out what else you can do to save our planet!</p>
